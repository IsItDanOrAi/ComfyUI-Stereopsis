description = "This initiative represents a solo venture dedicated to integrating a stereopsis effect within ComfyUI (Stable Diffusion). Presently, the project is focused on the refinement of node categorization within a unified framework, as it is in the early stages of development. However, it has achieved functionality in a fundamental capacity. By processing a video through the Side-by-Side (SBS) node and applying Frame Delay to one of the inputs, it facilitates the creation of a stereopsis effect. This effect is compatible with any Virtual Reality headset that supports SBS video playback, offering a practical application in immersive media experiences."
